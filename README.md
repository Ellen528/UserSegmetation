## Introduction
User segmentation is crucial for understanding the diverse needs and behaviors of customers. It allows businesses to create targeted marketing campaigns, improve customer satisfaction, and maximize ROI. This project aims to segment customers based on various attributes and provide actionable insights.

## Current Situation
Stakeholders currently have a general idea about the customer base but lack precise and actionable insights. This lack of clarity leads to less effective marketing strategies and suboptimal resource allocation.

## Methodology
The project uses the following machine learning techniques:
- **Data Integration**: Centralizing customer data from various sources.
- **Clustering**: Using algorithms like K-means and hierarchical clustering to group customers.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applying PCA to reduce data complexity.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Using the Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, and Davies-Bouldin Index to determine optimal clusters.
- **Automated Segmentation**: Setting up pipelines for dynamic updates to customer segments.

## Implementation and Utilization
Automated Segmentation: Setting up automated pipelines for dynamic updates to customer segments based on new data.
Detailed Variable Analysis and Visualization: Integrate tools like Tableau or Power BI to create interactive dashboards for detailed analysis.
